This mod adds the Anti-67 Sword, a powerful weapon for those who dislike the 67 meme.
The sword can be equipped to any C-button and shoots powerful beams when swung, similar to the Fierce Deity sword.
The Anti-67 Sword is automatically given to you at the start of the game.

Features:
- New equippable sword item
- Shoots energy beams on every swing
- Increased damage and range compared to standard swords
- Available from the start of the game
